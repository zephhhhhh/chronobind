# TODO list for ChronoBind

## High Priority
- Manual WoW install path selection (Also cache installs + add button to rescan the install folder instead of on every startup.)
- Full WoW backup creation and restoration for an entire WoW install (Interface + WTF)

## Medium Priority
- Import/Export backups (to enable sending profiles between users)
    - Drag and drop backups onto the window for this feature also
- File selection when restoring backup to only restore specific files
- Add configuration option to force override the auto determined better symbols support for other terminals.
- Maybe check `.flavor.info` info to verify install?

## Low Priority / Maybes
- (Maybe) Add either API support or an in-game addon that allows better retrieval of character classes
- Ability to hide certain characters to clean up UI.
- Ability to lock(read-only mode) certain characters to prevent accidental modification entirely.
